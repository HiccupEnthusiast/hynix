# Hynix
A project made to learn more about the inner workings of OS's and how to structure a large codebase. 
While one of the main objectives of this OS is to be viable as a daily drive OS, for the time being the OS isn't suitable for daily drive. It is merely a learning experience and once this objective is reached further maintaining isn't guaranteed.
